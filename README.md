## Prefab Design

The promise of Web Components inspires the Prefab Design system.
As a Web Standard components will have cross-framework compatability
removing the burden of rewrites for every JavaScript framework.
Prefab is short for prefabrication. It embodies the idea of
building something at scale, to be modular, and with mass appeal.
