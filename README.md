# Prefab UI

A suite of Web Component libraries built using the Prefab Design System.

## Libraries

### [pf-layouts](/packages/pf-layouts/README.md)

Standardize your team on these 5 viewport breakpoints. They cover mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop, and tv devices. Use them inside your layouts, pages, and custom components to build responsive mobile-first experiences.

### [pf-icons](/packages/pf-icons/README.md)

A suite of icons built using optimized SVG.

## Prefab Design System

***This section is for contributors to the project.***

This section is likely not necessary for you as it goes into the WHY of the decisions made with each component. If you can, I encourage you to stop reading this and go build something epic instead.

### Behind A Name

Web Components can ease the burden of learning the "next" JavaScript framework. As a Web Standard it promises cross-framework compatability for your components. It is from that promise the name **Prefab UI** is derived. Prefab is short for prefabrication. It embodies the idea of building something at scale, to be modular, and to strive for universal appeal.

### Principles

Principles bring clarity when making any decision. They are easy to remember while reducing complex problems into simple terms. In the effort of making decisions easier contributors follow three guiding principles.

- Build for **scale**.
- Build for **modularity**.
- Build for **universal appeal**.
